= Sets

== Introduction

Set theory provides a foundational language for all of mathematics.
_Everything_ from numbers and functions to spaces and relations can be defined using _sets_.
This lecture introduces the basic objects and operations of set theory and explores their deep structural and logical consequences.

Topics include:
- Basic concepts: elements, subsets, operations
- Relations and functions as sets
- Infinite sets and cardinality
- Axiomatic foundations
- Applications in logic and computer science

== Basic Notions

#definition[
  A _set_ is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called _elements_.

  - In _naïve_ set theory, sets can contain _any_ objects (including non-sets, called _urelements_).
  - In modern _axiomatic_ set theory, _everything is a set_ (no urelements).
]

#example[
  $A = {5, #emoji.koala, #emoji.bird}$ is a set of three elements: the number 5, a koala, and a birb.
]

*Notation:* $a in A$ means "$a$ is _an element of_ $A$".

#example[
  "$#emoji.koala in A$" is #True, while "$#emoji.penguin in A$" is #False, denoted as "$#emoji.penguin notin A$".
]

#definition[Extensionality][
  Two sets are _equal_, denoted $A = B$, if they have the same elements, that is, iff every element of $A$ is also in $B$, and vice versa.
  Formally, $A = B$ iff $A subset.eq B$ and $B subset.eq A$.
]

#example[
  ${a, b, b} = {a, b} = {b, a} = {b, a, b}$
]

== Set-Builder Notation

#definition[
  A set can be defined using _set-builder notation_ (_set comprehension_):
  $ A = { x | P(x) } $
  meaning "the set of all $x$ such that the property $P(x)$ holds".
]

#example[
  $A = { x | x in NN and x > 5 }$ is the set of natural numbers greater than 5, that is, $A = {6, 7, 8, dots}$.
]

#example[
  $S = { x^2 | x "is prime" } = {4, 9, 25, 49, dots}$ is the set of squares of prime numbers#footnote[*Note:* $1$ _is not_ a prime number.].
]

#example[
  $QQ = { a "/" b | a in ZZ, b in NN, b != 0 }$ is the set of rational numbers (fractions).
]

== Subsets

#definition[
  A set $A$ is a _subset_ of $B$, denoted $A subset.eq B$, if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.
  - Formally, $A subset.eq B iff forall x. thin (x in A) imply (x in B)$.
  - If $A$ is not a subset of $B$, we write $A subset.eq.not B$.
  - If $A subset.eq B$ and $A neq B$, we say $A$ is a _proper (or strict) subset_ of $B$, denoted $A subset B$ or $A subset.neq B$.
  - If $A$ is a subset of $B$, denoted $A subset.eq B$, then $B$ is a _superset_ of $A$, denoted $B supset.eq A$.
]

#example[
  Every set is a subset of itself: $A subset.eq A$.
]
#example[
  The empty set is a subset of every set: $emptyset subset.eq A$ for any set $A$.
]
#example[
  The set of even numbers is a proper subset of the set of integers: $ZZ_"even" subset ZZ$.
]
#example[
  ${a,b} subset.eq {a,b,c}$, but ${a,b,x} subset.eq.not {a,b,c}$.
]
#example[
  ${0} in {0, {0}}$ _and_ ${0} subset.eq {0, {0}}$, that is, ${0}$ is an element, and also a subset.
]

== Power Sets

#definition[
  The _power set_ of a set $A$, denoted $2^A$ or $power(A)$, is the set of all subsets of $A$.
  $ power(A) = { S | S subset.eq A } $
]

#example[
  If $A = {a, b}$, then $power(A) = {emptyset, {a}, {b}, {a, b}}$.
]
#example[
  If $A = {1, 2, 3}$, then $power(A) = {emptyset, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}$.
]
#example[
  The power set of the empty set is $power(emptyset) = {emptyset}$, a _non-empty_ set containing the empty set.
]

#theorem[
  $abs(power(A)) = 2^abs(A)$ for any finite set $A$.
]

#proof[(combinatorial)][
  For each of the $n$ elements in the set, we can either include it in a subset or not.
  These $n$ independent binary choices yield $2^n$ possible subsets by the multiplication principle.
  #place(center)[
    $ underbrace(2 times 2 times dots times 2, n " times") = 2^n $
  ]
]

#pagebreak()

#proof[
  By _induction_ on $n = abs(A)$, the cardinality of the set $A$.

  *Base case:*
  If $n = 0$, then $A = emptyset$ and $power(A) = {emptyset}$.
  Thus, $abs(power(A)) = 1 = 2^0$.

  *Inductive step:*
  Assume the formula holds for any set of size $k$.
  Let $A$ be a set with $abs(A) = k+1$.
  Choose an arbitrary element $a in A$ and let $A' = A setminus {a}$, so $abs(A') = k$.

  The power set $power(A)$ can be partitioned into two _disjoint_ collections:
  + Subsets of $A$ that _do not_ contain $a$.
  This collection is exactly $power(A')$.
  By the inductive hypothesis, it has $abs(power(A')) = 2^k$ elements.
  + Subsets of $A$ that _do_ contain $a$.
    Each such subset is of the form $S union {a}$ where $S subset.eq A'$.
    This establishes a bijection with $power(A')$, so this collection also has $2^k$ elements.

  The total number of subsets of $A$ is the _sum_ of their sizes: $abs(power(A)) = 2^k + 2^k = 2 dot 2^k = 2^(k+1)$.
]

== Some Important Sets

#example[
  $NN = {0, 1, 2, dots}$ is the set of natural numbers.
]
#example[
  $ZZ = {dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, dots}$ is the set of integers.
]
#example[
  $QQ = { a "/" b | a in ZZ, b in NN, b != 0 }$ is the set of rational numbers.
]
#example[
  $RR = (-infinity, +infinity)$ is the set of real numbers (the continuum).
]
#example[
  $BB = {0, 1}$ is the set of Boolean values (truth values).
]

#example[
  The set $A^*$ of _finite strings_ over an alphabet $A$ is defined as:
  $
    A^* = {epsilon} union { a_1 a_2 dots a_n | n in NN, a_i in A } = union.big_(n in NN) A^n
  $
  For example, $BB^* = { epsilon, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111, 0000, dots }$.
]

#example[
  The set $A^omega$ of _infinite sequences_ over $A$.
]

== Operations on Sets

#table(
  columns: 3,
  align: (left, right, left),
  stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) },
  table.header([Operation], [Notation], [Formal definition]),
  [Union], $A union B$, ${ x | x in A or x in B }$,
  [Intersection], $A intersect B$, ${ x | x in A and x in B }$,
  [Difference], $A setminus B$, ${ x | x in A and x notin B }$,
  [Symmetric diff.], $A triangle B$, $(A setminus B) union (B setminus A)$,
  [Complement], [$overline(A)$ or $A^c$], ${ x | x notin A }$,
  [Power set], [$2^A$ or $power(A)$], ${ S | S subset.eq A }$,
)

== Tuples and Ordered Pairs

#definition[
  A _tuple_ is an ordered collection of elements, denoted $(a_1, a_2, dots, a_n)$.

  A tuple of length $n$ is called an _n-tuple_.
]

#example[
  $(42, #emoji.crab, #emoji.cat.face.angry, #emoji.kiwi)$ is a 4-tuple.
]

#definition[
  An ordered pair $pair(a, b)$ is a special 2-tuple, defined#footnote[Kuratowski's definition is the most cited and now-accepted definition of an ordered pair. For others, see #link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair#Defining_the_ordered_pair_using_set_theory")[wiki].] as:
  $ pair(a, b) eq.def { {a}, {a, b} } $
]

#example[
  $pair(#emoji.pumpkin, #emoji.mage) != pair(#emoji.mage, #emoji.pumpkin)$, these are different ordered pairs.
]

#example[
  $pair(#emoji.cactus, #emoji.cactus) != (#emoji.cactus,) != #emoji.cactus != {#emoji.cactus}$, these are all different objects: an ordered pair, a 1-tuple, an~urelement, and a singleton~set.
  Note, however, that $pair(#emoji.cactus, #emoji.cactus) = {{#emoji.cactus}}$.
]

== Cartesian Product

#definition[
  The _Cartesian product_ of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A times B$, is defined as:
  $ A times B = { pair(a, b) | a in A "and" b in B } $
]

#example[
  If $A = {1, 2}$ and $B = {x, y, z}$, then their product is
  $ A times B = { pair(1, x), pair(1, y), pair(1, z), pair(2, x), pair(2, y), pair(2, z) } $
]

#definition[
  The _n-fold Cartesian product_ (also known as the _Cartesian power_) of a set $A$ is defined as:
  $ A^n = underbrace(A times A times dots times A, n "times") = { (a_1, a_2, dots, a_n) | a_i in A } $
]

#example[
  ${a, b}^3 = { (a,a,a), (a,a,b), (a,b,a), (a,b,b), (b,a,a), (b,a,b), (b,b,a), (b,b,b) }$
]

#example[
  ${#emoji.eagle}^3 = { (#emoji.eagle, #emoji.eagle, #emoji.eagle) }$, the singleton set containing the 3-tuple of three eagles.
]

#example[
  $A^0 = { () }$, the singleton set containing the empty tuple.
]

// Recursively, #strike("ab")using the Kuratowski's definition and extending $n$-tuples to pairs as $(x, y, z) = pair(pair(x, y), z)$:
// - $A^1 = A$
// - $A^(k + 1) = A^k times A$

== Russell’s Paradox

#place(right)[
  #grid(
    columns: 1,
    align: right,
    column-gutter: 1em,
    row-gutter: 0.5em,
    link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell", image("assets/Bertrand_Russell.jpg", height: 3cm)),
    [Bertrand Russell],
  )
]

Suppose a set can be either _"normal"_ or _"unusual"_.
- A set is considered _normal_ if it does _not contain itself_ as an element. That is, $A notin A$.
- Otherwise, it is _unusual_. That is, $A in A$.

*Note:* being "normal" or "unusual" is a predicate $P(x)$ that can be applied to any set $x$.

Consider the set $R$ of _all normal sets_:
$ R = { A | A notin A } $

The paradox arises when we ask: #strong[Is $R$ a normal set?]
- Suppose $R$ is _normal_. By its definition, $R$ must be an element of $R$, so $R in R$. But elements of $R$ are normal sets, and normal sets do not contain themselves. So $R notin R$. Contradiction.
- Suppose $R$ is _unusual_. This means $R$ contains itself, so $R in R$. But the definition of $R$ only includes sets that do _not_ contain themselves. So $R$ cannot be a member of $R$, i.e. $R notin R$. Contradiction.

A contradiction is reached in both cases. The only possible conclusion is that #strong[the set $R$ cannot exist].

This paradox showed that _unrestricted comprehension_ --- the ability to form a set from any arbitrary property --- is logically inconsistent.

= Relations

== Relations as Sets

#definition[
  A _binary relation_ $R$ on sets $A$ and $B$ is a subset of the Cartesian product $A times B$.
]

*Notation:*
If $R subset.eq A times B$, we write "$a rel(R) b$" to mean that element $a in A$ is _related_ to element $b in B$.

Formally, $a rel(R) b$ iff $pair(a, b) in R$.

*Note:* $R$ is used to denote both the relation itself ($a rel(R) b$) _and_ the set of pairs ($R subset.eq A times B$).

*Note:* the _order_ of elements in the pair _matters_: $pair(a, b) in R$ denotes that $a$ is related to $b$, not the other way around, unless there is _another_ pair $pair(b, a)$ in the relation.

#example[
  $R = { pair(n, k) | n, k in NN "and" n < k }$
]

#definition[
  A binary relation $R subset.eq A times B$ on two different sets $A$ and $B$ is called _heterogeneous_.
]
#definition[
  A binary relation $R subset.eq M^2$ on the same set $M$ is called _homogeneous_.
]

== Properties of Homogeneous Relations

#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _reflexive_ if every element is related to itself:
  $ forall x in M. thin (x rel(R) x) $
]
#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _symmetric_ if for every pair of elements, if one is related to the other, then the reverse is also true:
  $ forall x, y in M. thin (x rel(R) y) imply (y rel(R) x) $
]
#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _transitive_ if for every three elements, if the first is related to the second, and the second is related to the third, then the first is also related to the third:
  $ forall x, y, z in M. thin (x rel(R) y and y rel(R) z) imply (x rel(R) z) $
]

== More Properties

#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _irreflexive_ if no element is related to itself:
  $ forall x in M. thin (x nrel(R) x) $
]
#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _antisymmetric_ if for every pair of elements, if both are related to each other, then they must be equal:
  $ forall x, y in M. thin (x rel(R) y and y rel(R) x) imply (x = y) $
]
#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _asymmetric_ if for every pair of elements, if one is related to the other, then the reverse is not true:
  $ forall x, y in M. thin (x rel(R) y) imply (y nrel(R) x) $
]

#note[
  _irreflexive_ + _antisymmetric_ = _asymmetric_.
]

== Equivalence Relations

#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is an _equivalence relation_ if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
]

#definition[
  Let $R subset.eq M^2$ be an equivalence relation on a set $M$.
  The _equivalence class_ of an element $x in M$ under $R$ is the set of all elements related to $x$:
  $ [x]_R = { y in M | x rel(R) y } $
]

#definition[
  The _quotient set_ of $M$ by the equivalence relation $R$ is the set of all equivalence classes:
  $ M slash_R = { [x]_R | x in M } $
]

#theorem[
  If $R subset.eq M^2$ is an equivalence relation, then $x rel(R) y$ iff $[x]_R = [y]_R$ for all $x, y in M$.
]

== Orders

#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is called a _preorder_ if it is reflexive and transitive.
]
#definition[
  A preorder which is also antisymmetric is called a _partial order_.
]
#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _connected_ if for every pair of distinct elements, either one is related to the other or vice versa:
  $ forall x, y in M. thin (x neq y) imply (x rel(R) y or y rel(R) x) $
]
#definition[
  A partial order which is also connected is called a _total order_ (or _linear order_).
]

#example[
  Consider the _no longer than_ relation $prec.curly.eq$ on $BB^*$: $x prec.curly.eq y$ iff $"len"(x) <= "len"(y)$.
  This is a preorder (reflexive and transitive), and even connected, but not a partial order, since it is not antisymmetric: for example, $01 prec.curly.eq 10$ and $10 prec.curly.eq 01$, but $01 neq 10$.
]

= Functions

== Definition of a Function

#definition[
  A _function_ $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$, denoted $f: A to B$, is a special kind of relation $f subset.eq A times B$ where every element of $A$ is paired with _exactly one_ element of $B$.

  This means two conditions must hold:
  + _Functional (left-total)_:
    For every $a in A$, there is _at least one_ pair $pair(a, b)$ in $f$.
    $ forall a in A, exists b in B: pair(a, b) in f $
  + _Serial (right-unique)_:
    For every $a in A$, there is _at most one_ pair $pair(a, b)$ in $f$.
    $ (pair(a, b_1) in f and pair(a, b_2) in f) ==> b_1 = b_2 $
]

#definition[
  A relation that satisfies the functional property is called a _partial function_.

  A relation that satisfies both properties is called a _total function_, or simply a _function_.
]

== Domain, Codomain, Range

#definition[
  For a function $f: A to B$:
  - The set $A$ is called the _domain_ of $f$, denoted $dom(f)$.
  - The set $B$ is called the _codomain_ of $f$, denoted $cod(f)$.
  - The _range_ (or _image_) of $f$ is the set of all values that $f$ actually takes:
    $ range(f) = "Im"(f) = { b in B | exists a in A, f(a) = b } = { f(a) | a in A } $
  Note that $range(f) subset.eq cod(f)$.
]

#example[
  Let $A = {1, 2, 3}$ and $B = {x, y, z}$.
  Let $f = {pair(1, x), pair(2, y), pair(3, x)}$.
  - $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$.
  - $dom(f) = A$.
  - $cod(f) = B$.
  - $range(f) = {x, y}$.
  We have $f(1)=x$, $f(2)=y$, $f(3)=x$.

== Injective Functions

#definition[
  A function $f: A to B$ is _injective_ (or _one-to-one_#footnote[Do not confuse it with _one-to-one correspondence_, which is a bijection, not just injection!]) if distinct elements in the domain map to distinct elements in the codomain.
  $ forall a_1, a_2 in A, (f(a_1) = f(a_2)) ==> (a_1 = a_2) $
]

#example[
  $f: NN to NN$ defined by $f(n) = 2n$ is injective.
  If $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$, then $2n_1 = 2n_2$, so $n_1 = n_2$.
]
#example[
  $g: ZZ to ZZ$ defined by $g(n) = n^2$ is _not_ injective, because $g(-1) = 1$ and $g(1) = 1$, but $-1 != 1$.
]

== Surjective Functions

#definition[
  A function $f: A to B$ is _surjective_ (or _onto_) if every element in the codomain is the image of at least one element in the domain.
  $ forall b in B. thin exists a in A. thin f(a) = b $
  For surjective functions, $range(f) = cod(f)$.
]

#example[
  $f: RR to RR$ defined by $f(x) = x^3$ is surjective. For any $y in RR$, $x = root(3, y)$ is such that $f(x)=y$.
]
#example[
  $g: NN to NN$ defined by $g(n) = 2n$ is _not_ surjective, because odd numbers in $NN$ (the codomain) are not in the range of $g$. For example, there is no $n in NN$ such that $2n = 3$.
]

== Bijective Functions

#definition[
  A function $f: A to B$ is _bijective_ if it is both injective and surjective.
  A bijective function establishes a _one-to-one correspondence_ between the elements of $A$ and $B$.
]

#example[
  $f: RR to RR$ defined by $f(x) = 2x + 1$ is bijective.
  - Injective: If $2x_1+1 = 2x_2+1$, then $2x_1 = 2x_2$, so $x_1=x_2$.
  - Surjective: For any $y in RR$, let $x = (y-1) / 2$. Then $f(x) = 2((y-1) / 2) + 1 = y-1+1 = y$.
]
#example[
  The identity function $id_A: A to A$ defined by $id_A(x) = x$ for all $x in A$ is bijective.
]

== Function Composition

#definition[
  Let $f: A to B$ and $g: B to C$ be two functions.
  The _composition_ of $g$ and $f$, denoted $g compose f$ (read as "$g$ composed with $f$" or "$g$ after $f$"), is a function from $A$ to $C$ defined by:
  $ (g compose f)(a) = g(f(a)) $
  // for all $a in A$.
]

#example[
  Let $f: RR to RR$ be $f(x) = x^2$ and $g: RR to RR$ be $g(x) = x+1$.
  - $(g compose f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(x^2) = x^2 + 1$.
  - $(f compose g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x+1) = (x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$.
  Note that in general, $g compose f != f compose g$.
]

#theorem[Properties of Composition][
  - _Associativity:_ If $f: A to B$, $g: B to C$, and $h: C to D$, then $(h compose g) compose f = h compose (g compose f)$.
  - The _identity_ function acts as a _neutral_ element for composition:
    - $id_B compose f = f$ for any function $f: A to B$.
    - $f compose id_A = f$ for any function $f: A to B$.
  - Composition _preserves_ the properties of functions:
    - If $f$ and $g$ are injective, so is $g compose f$.
    - If $f$ and $g$ are surjective, so is $g compose f$.
    - If $f$ and $g$ are bijective, so is $g compose f$.

== Inverse Functions

  If $f: A to B$ is a bijective function, then its _inverse function_, denoted $f^(-1): B to A$, is~defined as:
  $ f^(-1)(b) = a quad "iff" quad f(a) = b $.
]

#note[
  A function has an inverse _if and only if_ it is bijective.
]

#example[
  Let $f: RR to RR$ be $f(x) = 2x + 1$.
  We found it's bijective.
  To find $f^(-1)(y)$, let $y = 2x+1$.
  Solving for $x$, we get $x = (y-1) / 2$.
  So, $f^(-1)(y) = (y-1) / 2$.
]

#theorem[
  If $f: A to B$ is a bijective function with inverse $f^(-1): B to A$:
  - $f^(-1)$ is also bijective.
  - $(f^(-1) compose f)(a) = a$ for all $a in A$ (i.e., $f^(-1) compose f = id_A$).
  - $(f compose f^(-1))(b) = b$ for all $b in B$ (i.e., $f compose f^(-1) = id_B$).
  - If $f: A to B$ and $g: B to C$ are both bijective, then $(g compose f)^(-1) = f^(-1) compose g^(-1)$.

== Image and Preimage of Sets

#definition[
  Let $f: A to B$ be a function and let $S subset.eq A$.
  The _image of $S$ under $f$_ is the set:
  $ f(S) = { f(s) | s in S } $
  Note that $f(S) subset.eq B$.
  The range of $f$ is $f(A)$.
]

#definition[
  Let $f: A to B$ be a function and let $T subset.eq B$.
  The _preimage of $T$ under $f$_ (or _inverse image of $T$_) is the set of all elements in the domain that map into $T$:
  $ f^(-1)(T) = { a in A | f(a) in T } $
]

#note[
  The notation $f^(-1)(T)$ is used even if the inverse function $f^(-1)$ does not exist (i.e., if $f$ is not bijective).
  It always refers to the set of domain elements that map into $T$.
]

#pagebreak()

#example[
  Let $f: ZZ -> ZZ$ be $f(x) = x^2$.
  - Let $S = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}$. Then $f(S) = {f(-2), f(-1), f(0), f(1), f(2)} = {4, 1, 0, 1, 4} = {0, 1, 4}$.
  - Let $T_1 = {1, 9}$. The preimage is $f^(-1)(T_1) = {x in ZZ | x^2 in {1, 9}} = {-3, -1, 1, 3}$.
  - Let $T_2 = {2, 3}$. The preimage is $f^(-1)(T_2) = {x in ZZ | x^2 in {2, 3}} = emptyset$.

= Cardinality

== Size of Sets

#definition[
  The _size_ of a _finite_ set $X$, denoted $abs(X)$, is the number of elements it contains.

  // For a _finite_ set $X$, its _size_, denoted $abs(X)$, is the number of elements it contains.

  // If a finite set is enumerated as $X = {x_1, dots, x_n}$, then its size is $n$.
]

#examples[
  - Let $A = {#emoji.planet, #emoji.dino, #emoji.violin}$, then $abs(A) = 3$, since $A$ contains _exactly 3_ elements.
  - Let $B = {#emoji.kiwi, #emoji.kiwi, #emoji.kiwi}$, then $abs(B) = 1$, since $B$ contains _only one unique_ element (the kiwi).
  - $abs(power({1,2,3})) = 2^3 = 8$, since the power set consists of _all 8 possible subsets_ of ${1, 2, 3}$.
  - $abs(emptyset) = 0$, since the _empty_ set contains _no elements_.
  - $abs(NN) = infinity$, since there are _infinitely many_ natural numbers.
  - $abs(RR) = infinity$, since there are _infinitely many_ real numbers.
]

== Cardinality of Sets

#definition[
  Two sets $A$ and $B$ have the same _cardinality_ and called _equinumerous_, denoted #box[$abs(A) = abs(B)$] or $A equinumerous B$, iff there is a _bijection_ (one-to-one correspondence) from $A$ to $B$.
]

// TODO: proposition
#theorem[
  Equinumerosity is an equivalence relation.
]

#proof[
  Let $A$, $B$, $C$ be sets.
  - _Reflexivity:_
    The identity map $id_A: A to A$, where $id_A (x) = x$, is a bijection, so $A equinumerous A$.
  - _Symmetry:_
    Suppose $A equinumerous B$, then there is a bijection $f: A to B$.
    Since it is a bijection, its inverse $f^(-1)$ exists and is also a bijection.
    Hence, $f^(-1): B to A$ is a bijection, so $B equinumerous A$.
  - _Transitivity:_
    Suppose that $A equinumerous B$ and $B equinumerous C$, i.e., there are bijections $f: A to B$ and $g: B to C$.
    Then~the composition $g compose f: A to C$ is also a bijection.
    So $A equinumerous C$.
]

// TODO: proposition
// #theorem[
//   If $A equinumerous B$, then $A$ is countable if and only if $B$ is.
// ]

== Countable Sets

#definition[
  A set called _countable_ if it is either finite or has the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers $NN$.
  Alternatively, a set is countable if there is a _bijection_ from $NN$ to that set.

  When an infinite set is _countable_, its cardinality is denoted $aleph_0$ (_"aleph-null"_ ).
]

#example[
  $abs(NN_"odd" = {x in NN | x "is odd"}) = aleph_0$, the set of _odd_ natural numbers is countable.

  - There is a bijection $f: NN to NN_"odd"$ defined by $f(n) = 2n + 1$.
]

#example[
  $abs({x in NN | x "is prime"}) = aleph_0$, the set of _prime_ numbers is countable.
]

#example[
  $abs(ZZ) = aleph_0$, the set of _integers_ ($-infinity, dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, dots, infinity$) is countable.

  - There is a bijection $f: NN to ZZ$ defined by $f(n) = (-1)^n ceil(n / 2) = cases(n/2 & "if" n "is even", -(n+1)/2 & "if" n "is odd")$.

== Pairing Functions

#definition[
  A function $f: A times B to NN$ is an arithmetical _pairing function_ if it is injective.

  We say that $f$ _encodes_ $A times B$, and that $f(a, b)$ is the _code_ of the pair $pair(a, b)$.
]

#example[
  The _Cantor pairing function_ $g: NN^2 to NN$ is defined as:
  $
    g(n, k) = frac((n+k+1)(n+k), 2) + n
  $
]

== Sets of Different Sizes

#definition[
  The cardinality of a set $A$ is _less than or the same_ as the cardinality of a set $B$, denoted $abs(A) <= abs(B)$ or $A smaller.eq B$, if there is an _injection_ (one-to-one function) from $A$ to $B$.
  // Set $A$ is _no larger than_ $B$, denoted $A smaller.eq B$, iff there is an _injection_ from $A$ to $B$.
]

#definition[
  Set $A$ is _smaller_ than $B$, denoted $abs(A) < abs(B)$ or $A smaller B$, iff there is an _injection_, but _no~bijection_ from $A$ to $B$, i.e., $A smaller.eq B$ and $A equinumerous.not B$.
]

#example[
  ${1, 2} smaller {a, b, c}$, since there is an injection $f: {1, 2} to {a, b, c}$ defined by $f(1) = a$ and $f(2) = b$, but no bijection exists.
]

#example[
  $NN smaller.eq ZZ$, since there is bijection (and thus an injection) $f: NN to ZZ$.
]

#example[
  $ZZ smaller.eq NN$, since there is bijection (and thus an injection) $f: ZZ to NN$.
]

== Cantor's Theorem

#theorem[Cantor][
  $A smaller power(A)$, for any set $A$.
]

#proof[
  The map $f(x) = {x}$ is an injection $f: A to power(A)$, since if $x != y$, then also ${x} != {y}$ by extensionality, and so $f(x) != f(y)$.
  So we have that $A smaller.eq power(A)$.

  It remains to show that $A equinumerous.not B$.
  For reductio, suppose $A equinumerous B$, i.e., there is some bijection $g: A to B$.
  Now~consider $D = {x in A | x notin g(x)}$.
  Note that $D subset.eq A$, so $D in power(A)$.
  Since $g$ is a bijection, there exists some $y in A$ such that $g(y) = D$.
  But now we have
  // $y in g(y)$ iff $y in D$ iff $y notin g(y)$.
  $
    y in g(y) "iff" y in D "iff" y notin g(y)
  $
  This is a contradiction, since $y$ cannot be both _in_ and _not in_ $g(y)$.
  Thus, $A equinumerous.not power(A)$.
