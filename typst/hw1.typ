== Problem 2: Dynamic Security Classification System

A cybersecurity company develops an adaptive threat classification system that evolves based on emerging threats.
The system must handle overlapping categories and dynamic priority assignments.

*Part (a):*
Given three evolving threat _categories_:
- $T_1 = {x | x "is a network-based attack"}$
- $T_2 = {x | x "targets user credentials"}$
- $T_3 = {x | x "uses social engineering"}$

Consider specific threats: ${"malware", "phishing", "ddos", "vishing", "smishing", "ransomware", "keylogger"}$

+ Classify each threat into appropriate categories (a threat can belong to multiple categories).
+ Prove that for any finite universe $U$ and subsets $A, B, C subset.eq U$:
  $
    card(A union B union C) = card(A) + card(B) + card(C) - card(A inter B) - card(A inter C) - card(B inter C) + card(A inter B inter C)
  $

+ Apply this formula to verify your classification counts.

*Part (b):*
The system uses machine learning with confidence scores. Define:
- High-confidence: $H = {x in U | "conf"(x) >= 0.8}$
- Medium-confidence: $M = {x in U | 0.4 <= "conf"(x) < 0.8}$
- Low-confidence: $L = {x in U | "conf"(x) < 0.4}$

Given that exactly 40% of threats have high confidence, 35% have medium confidence:
+ Prove that ${H, M, L}$ forms a partition of $U$.
+ If $card(U) = 100$ threats, determine $card(H)$, $card(M)$, and $card(L)$.
+ Show that for any partition ${A_1, A_2, ..., A_n}$ of a finite set $S$: $sum_(i=1)^n card(A_i) = card(S)$.

*Part (c):*
The system assigns priority based on both threat category overlap and detection confidence. Define a priority function:
$"priority"(x) = card({i | x in T_i}) + "confidence-weight"(x)$

where confidence-weight is: 3 for high, 2 for medium, 1 for low confidence.

+ For the threat "phishing" (assume it belongs to $T_2$ and $T_3$, with high confidence), compute its priority score.
+ Prove that if threat $a$ belongs to more categories than threat $b$, and both have the same confidence level, then $"priority"(a) > "priority"(b)$.
+ Design a formal definition for "critical threats" using set operations and priority thresholds that ensures exactly the top 20% of threats by priority are classified as critical.

*Part (d):*
The company wants to minimize false positives while maximizing threat coverage.
Define:
- Detected: $D = H union M$
  #h(1fr) (system only acts on medium+ confidence)
- Actual threats: $A subset.eq U$
  #h(1fr) (unknown true threat set)
- False positives: $F = D without A$
  #h(1fr) (detected but not actual threats)
- Coverage rate: $card(D inter A) "/" card(A)$
  #h(1fr) (how many actual threats are detected)
- Precision rate: $card(D inter A) "/" card(D)$
  #h(1fr) (how many detected threats are actual)

+ Express the relationship between coverage, precision, and the sizes of sets $D$, $A$, and $F$.
+ Prove that improving coverage (increasing $card(D inter A)$) while keeping $card(D)$ constant requires decreasing false positives $card(F)$.
+ If the system must maintain precision $>= 0.75$ and coverage $>= 0.85$, derive constraints on $card(A)$, $card(D)$, and $card(F)$ in terms of $card(U)$.


== Problem 3: Similarity and Distance Metrics

Streaming services use similarity measures to recommend content.
Consider user preferences as sets of genres they enjoy.

Users and their preferred genres:
- Alice: $A = {"sci-fi", "thriller", "drama"}$
- Bob: $B = {"comedy", "thriller", "action"}$
- Carol: $C = {"drama", "romance", "thriller"}$
- David: $D = {"sci-fi", "action", "horror"}$

*Part (a): Jaccard Similarity and Distance*

The _Jaccard similarity_ between users $X$ and $Y$ is defined as:
$
  Jaccard(X, Y) = frac(
    card(X inter Y),
    card(X union Y)
  )
$
with the convention that $Jaccard(emptyset, emptyset) = 1$.

The _Jaccard distance_ measures dissimilarity:
$
  JaccardDist(X, Y) = 1 - Jaccard(X, Y)
$

+ Calculate $Jaccard(X, Y)$ and $JaccardDist(X, Y)$ for all pairs among given users.
+ Determine which pair is most similar and which is most dissimilar.

*Part (b): Cosine Similarity and Distance*

The _Cosine similarity_ (simplified for sets) is:
$
  Cosine(X, Y) = frac(
    card(X inter Y),
    sqrt(card(X)) dot sqrt(card(Y))
  )
$

The _Cosine distance_ is:
$
  CosineDist(X, Y) = 1 - Cosine(X, Y)
$

+ Calculate $Cosine(X, Y)$ and $CosineDist(X, Y)$ for all user pairs.
+ Determine which pair is most similar and which is most dissimilar.

*Part (c): Metric Properties*

Prove that Jaccard distance satisfies the triangle inequality:
$
  JaccardDist(A, C) <= JaccardDist(A, B) + JaccardDist(B, C)
$
for arbitrary finite sets $A$, $B$, and $C$.

*Part (d): Counterexample for Cosine Distance*

Show that cosine distance does NOT satisfy the triangle inequality by providing a specific counterexample.
Find three non-empty sets $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ such that:
$
  CosineDist(X, Z) > CosineDist(X, Y) + CosineDist(Y, Z)
$

*Hint*: Try sets of different sizes where one set has no intersection with the others.

*Part (e): Recommendation Application*

A user with preferences $U = {"thriller", "horror"}$ joins the platform.
Using Jaccard similarity, find:
+ Users with similarity $>= 0.2$ to user $U$.
+ The most similar user to $U$.
+ Recommended genres based on the most similar user's preferences.


== Problem 5: Game Development and Coordinate Systems

A game developer is designing a 2D puzzle game with different gameplay zones.
Each zone is defined by specific coordinate regions in $RR^2$.

*Part (a):*
Sketch each gameplay zone in the coordinate plane:
+ Safe Zone: $[1, 4] times [2, 5]$
+ Danger Zone: $(2, 6] times [1, 4)$
+ Treasure Zone: ${(x,y) | x in {1, 3, 5}, y in [2, 4)}$
+ Boss Arena: ${(x,y) in [1, 6] times [1, 6] | (x-6)^2 + (y-1)^2 < 9}$

// TODO: replace part b
// *Part (b):*
// The game mechanics require calculating the area of zone interactions:
// + Overlap of Safe and Danger zones: $(text("Safe Zone")) inter (text("Danger Zone"))$
// + Safe areas outside Danger zone: $(text("Safe Zone")) without (text("Danger Zone"))$
// + All special locations: $text("Treasure Zone") union text("Boss Arena")$

*Part (b):*
Power-ups spawn at lattice points (integer coordinates) within zones.
+ Count lattice points in Safe Zone.
+ Count lattice points in the overlap of Safe and Danger zones.
+ Find lattice points in Treasure Zone.

// TODO: re-formulate part d
// *Part (d):*
// A player moves from point $(2,3)$ to $(4,1)$.
// + Through which zones does the straight-line path pass?
// + Through which zones does the Manhattan path pass?


== Problem 6: Recursive Data Structures

In computer science, data structures often have self-referential definitions.
Consider the following system where sets reference their own cardinalities.

*Part (a):*
Find all sets $A$ and $B$ that satisfy:
$
  A & = {1, 2, card(B)} \
  B & = {card(A), 3, 4}
$

Start by determining possible values for $card(A)$ and $card(B)$, then verify which combinations work.

*Part (b):*
Consider a more complex system:
$
  X & = {0, card(Y), card(Z)} \
  Y & = {1, card(X)} \
  Z & = {card(X), card(Y), 2}
$

Find all valid solutions $(X, Y, Z)$.
Explain why some potential solutions don't work.

*Part (c):*
Design your own self-referential system with three sets that has:
- Exactly one valid solution
- At least one set containing the number 5
- Each set having exactly 2 elements

Provide the system and prove your solution is unique.


== Problem 7: Fuzzy Sets and Approximate Membership

In many realâ€‘world systems, categorical boundaries are blurred.
_Fuzzy sets_ model the graded (probabilistic or partial) membership via a function $mu(x) in [0;1] subset.eq RR$ assigning each element a _membership degree_ representing how "strongly" the element belongs to the set.

Consider two fuzzy sets over the same finite universe $X = {a,b,c,d,e}$:
$
  F = { a:0.4, b:0.8, c:0.2, d:0.9, e:0.7 } \
  R = { a:0.6, b:0.9, c:0.4, d:0.1, e:0.5 }
$

*Part (a): Complement.*
Define $mu_overline(S)(x) = 1 - mu_S (x)$.
Compute $overline(F)$ and $overline(R)$.

*Part (b): Union (max tâ€‘conorm).*
For $S union T$: $mu_(S union T)(x) = max(mu_S (x), mu_T (x))$. Compute $F union R$.

*Part (c): Intersection (min tâ€‘norm).*
For $S inter T$: $mu_(S inter T)(x) = min(mu_S (x), mu_T (x))$.
Compute $F inter R$.

*Part (d): Difference.*
Propose and justify a definition for $S without T$.
Using your chosen definition, compute $F without R$ and $R without F$.

*Part (e): Fuzzy Jaccard similarity.*
One fuzzy analogue:
$
  Jaccard_f (F,R) = frac(
    sum_(x in X) min { mu_F (x), mu_R (x) },
    sum_(x in X) max { mu_F (x), mu_R (x) }
  )
$
Compute $Jaccard_f (F,R)$ and the corresponding distance $1 - Jaccard_f (F,R)$.

*Part (f): Defuzzification.*
Suppose a system triggers an alert if an elementâ€™s membership in $F union R$ exceeds 0.75.
List all triggered elements with their degrees and briefly comment on the tradeâ€‘off between using crisp vs fuzzy thresholds.

// *Optional:* Compare ordering of elements by membership in $F$, $R$, and $F union R$.
// Explain how this could influence a recommendation system (Problem 4).


== Problem 8: Set Theory Foundations and Proofs

*Part (a):*
Consider the set $R = {x | x notin x}$ (the set of all sets that do not contain themselves).
+ Prove that assuming $R in R$ leads to a contradiction.
+ Prove that assuming $R notin R$ also leads to a contradiction.
+ Explain why this shows that naive set theory is inconsistent.
+ How do modern axiomatic set theories (like ZFC) avoid this paradox?

*Part (b):*
Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets. Prove or disprove each statement:
+ If $A subset.eq B$, then $power(A) subset.eq power(B)$
+ $power(A inter B) = power(A) inter power(B)$
+ $power(A union B) = power(A) union power(B)$
+ $card(power(A times B)) = 2^(card(A) dot card(B))$

*Part (c):*
Provide complete proofs for each of the following statements:
+ Prove that the set of even natural numbers has the same cardinality as $NN$.
+ Prove that $card(NN times NN) = card(NN)$.
+ Show that if $A$ is countable and $B$ is uncountable, then $A union B$ is uncountable.
+ Prove or disprove: If $card(A) = card(B)$ and $card(C) = card(D)$, then $card(A times C) = card(B times D)$.
